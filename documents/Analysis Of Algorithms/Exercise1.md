### ALGS4 Exercise 1.2.1

Number of choices: C(N)

Since we are going to choose three different integers from N integers:

The first integer has N choices, the second integer has N - 1 choices and the third integer has N - 2 choices.

s.t. We have A(N)=N(N-1)(N-2) possibilities of arrangements.

Apparently, 6 arrangements for 3 integers.

Then we get:

![C{N)=A(N)=N(N-1)(N-2)/6](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C(N)=\\frac{A(N)}{6}=\\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)}{6})
